Homework 2 – Ionic with Angular and TypeScript 

USE CASE: 
•  An online cafe called INF Café has tasked you with redesigning their mobile application for use by their customers 
•  You will need to create a front end with three pages: a Products page, a Basket page, and a Previous Orders page. 
•  You will be provided with the application back end and you will need to access the endpoints found in the product and order controllers to send and receive data from the database - You do not need to code anything within the back-end API, only make use of the endpoints provided. 
•  When the application is launched, the landing page must be the Products page, and navigation to the second and  third  pages  must  be  done  via  tabs,  subject  to  the  restrictions  that  will  be  detailed  under  “Standard Requirements”.
